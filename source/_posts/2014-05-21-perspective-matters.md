Last weekend, during the ending Q&A session of [PhpDay](http://2014.phpday.it/) Italy, an attendee asked the speakers what would be their best advice for other developers. This can sound like a "cliche" question, because there are a few obvious answers we can think about, like: "keep learning", "contribute to open source projects", "be open to new technologies", and such. Don't get me wrong: these are all great and very important advises. But I think everybody already knows that, even those who don't put said advises in practice. That's why I felt amazed by what I considered to be a quite unexpected answer, from [Jordi Boggiano](https://twitter.com/seldaek). He advised us to practice **empathy**. As he said, many people don't even know what _empathy_ means.

> **_Empathy_**: the ability to understand and share the feelings of another.

Empathy can also be described as the ability to place yourself into someone else's **perspective**, and try to understand how the environment surrounding that person can influence their feelings and behavior. Empathy is all about emulating another _mindset_.

And why he advised _empathy_ for developers? Mainly because it's easy to forget that there's another human being, just like us, in the other side of that _comment box_ - whether if it's a blog post or a pull request on GitHub. 

But it's not only about how we behave on the Internet - it's also about how we comprehend the world around us. It's hard to see beyond our perspective; but if we don't, we are fated to a very limited viewpoint based on our own experiences.

If you are a native English speaker, for instance, and you work with IT, you have a clear advantage over thousands of other developers, and you might not realize that. I thought about this after talking with some Italian developers and finding out that their IT market is, in many ways, very similar to what we have in Brazil.  The language influences in terms that the average developer won't learn a new technology as fast as you - as a native English speaker - would, just by reading some tutorials. It will be an **extra** effort. And let's be honest: English is, indeed, the _official language_ for tech. This will influence the market in different ways, but basically it will take some time for anything new to get spread in those locations.

From _my_ perspective, being in an international conference **as a speaker**, and getting to know [Rasmus Lerdorf](https://twitter.com/rasmus) face to face, having a conversation with him and with other famous PHP developers from all over the world, is just surreal. Back to the _English_ problem, it took me a big deal of effort to just believe I could present a talk in English - that was the first step, _believing_. I think I could only do all of this because I didn't wait until I felt ready to start - the truth is that we _never_ feel ready.

Naturally, for other experienced speaker's perspectives, that was just _normal_.

Two weeks before PhpDay, it crossed my mind that there was a **very small chance** Rasmus would watch my talk; this thought got me terrified. I cleared my had of it, because _certainly that would not happen_. When it **did** happen, I didn't have much time to overthink the situation, and everything felt just... _normal_. After that, I had a **change of perspective**. It's not because I don't have fear anymore, it's because I know I am able to overcome it.

I'm only telling all this story because, ten years ago, I would love to read it, as a young developer with big dreams. There are no limits for what you can accomplish, it will only depend on you.

So, I didn't take the microphone to give an advice that day, but I will do it here: start before you feel that you are ready. Be a **doer** and try to see the world through different perspectives. And as Rasmus said (not in this exact words, but that's what I got), don't let people put you down; for each Internet _troller_ and individuals with no capacity for empathy at all, there are _at least_ 10 good people who will help you with real feedback and words of encouragement. And I think he really _knows_ what he is talking about.
